Each must be bought separately and should be noted like &lsquo;Super Sense (Dark Vision)&rsquo;. Different Super Senses can be combined, using the same skill roll, or they can be used separately. Following are common Super Senses, though you and your gamemaster may introduce others:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Dark Vision</strong>: See 15 meters in absolute darkness, canceling any negative modifiers to the Spot or combat skills due to darkness. Detection of color is almost nonexistent, and long-range sight is extremely limited. Each extra level increases the range by 15 meters.</li>\n<li><strong>Microscopic Vision</strong>: See microscopic objects in considerable detail.&nbsp; At level 1, the rate of magnification is 25&times; (25 times normal size). For each additional level, double the existing magnification (25&times; becomes 50&times;, then 100&times;, then 200&times;, etc.), or add an additional 15 meters range. Use of Microscopic Vision is incompatible with normal sight&mdash;it must be deactivated to perceive the world normally.&nbsp;&nbsp;This can be done instantly, but it must be reactivated to use again.</li>\n<li><strong>Night Vision</strong>: If there is a source of light (however faint), your character can see with perfect clarity for 15 meters. This cancels any negative modifiers to Spot or combat due to partial darkness. Night Vision allows for some differentiation between colors and provides the sharpest form of vision in near-dark conditions. Each additional level increases the range by another 15 meters.</li>\n<li><strong>Sonar Detection</strong>: Hear ambient sounds (or creates them) and use them for echolocation, determining the presence of other beings, obstacles, and the terrain in range. Each level provides a 15-meter, 360-degree field of sonar detection, projected from the head. Use the Listen skill to notice a particular feature, and an Idea roll to identify it. Each additional level of this power adds 15 meters to the range.</li>\n<li><strong>Super Hearing</strong>: Each level doubles the effective range of the Listen skill. Normal hearing range is 15 meters, assuming there is no intervening obstacle (such as a wall) or noise-making interference. This can also be used to hear things outside human range of perception, such as an opponent&rsquo;s heartbeat. This superpower also allows your character to hear opponents even if they have successfully&nbsp;used the Stealth skill. If an opponent has an average success on a Stealth roll, an Easy Listen roll detects them. If the opponent has a special success, an unmodified Listen success hears them. Even a critical success with Stealth is heard with a special success.</li>\n<li><strong>Super Smell/Taste</strong>: Use their Sense skill to detect the taste of something a normal human would be unable to discern, such as a tasteless poison. Each level increases the range of the sense of smell by another 15 meters, so your character can smell something faint at great range. Taste increases by 1 meter per level, so your character can even taste something within range without having to consume it.</li>\n<li><strong>Super Touch</strong>: Each level lets the Sense skill detect subtle changes in texture through fingertips or other body parts. It also gives the ability to &lsquo;see&rsquo; with exposed skin, acting in darkness as if in normal daylight, ignoring any penalties from darkness (use the Listen skill). Finally, it provides a POW&times;level chance of detecting oncoming missile weapons or other hand-to-hand attacks that might not be detected otherwise (an ambush or backstab). The range is 15 meters. Each additional level extends the range by 15 meters.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Super Vision</strong>: Each level doubles the distance your character can see detail in, doubling the range at which they can use skills such as Spot. It also increases the magnification that your character is capable of, allowing them to perform skills such as Appraise at long range.</li>\n<li><strong>Thermal Vision</strong>: Detect heat patterns within range, allowing them to see living beings in the dark through bodily heat. Heat sources appear as red blurs in a bluish-black background. Everything outside the range of the power is an indistinct blur, and the superpower does not allow detection of objects that do not emit heat, such as furniture or walls, unless they are wired to do so. Each additional level increases the range by another 15 meters.</li>\n<li><strong>Ultrasonic Hearing</strong>: Hear sounds that would be inaudible to a normal human, above or below audible frequencies. Use your character&rsquo;s Listen skill to see if the sound is noticed. A wall or other barrier 10 centimeters thick will block most sounds from passing through, but this superpower negates that blockage. Each additional level increases range by 15 meters and increases the ability to hear through barriers that would normally block sounds (2 levels allows hearing through 20 centimeters of barrier, 3 levels through 30 centimeters of barrier, etc.). Ultrasonic Hearing does not give your character sonar detection (as&nbsp; described above).</li>\n<li><strong>X-Ray Vision</strong>: See through 10 centimeters of any substance per level, blocked only by a single substance such as lead, gold, or some other higher-density substance (player choice). The range is 15 meters. Each additional level increases range by 15 meters and the penetrating value of the power by an additional 10 centimeters. With enough levels, make Spot or other visual perception skill rolls unimpaired, even when obstructed by a barrier.</li>\n</ul>","gmDescription":"","powerMod":[],"category":"","cpc":"3","cpcSpent":0,"level":1,"range":"Varies","duration":"Always On","pppl":"0","specialism":true,"specName":"specify","mainName":"Super Sense","chosen":false,"failing":[]},"effects":[],"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":"brp","systemVersion":"11.0.37","coreVersion":"11.315","createdTime":1701325602149,"modifiedTime":1702582662248,"lastModifiedBy":"NiJh555W408VQRFB"},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"NiJh555W408VQRFB":3}}

The means can be a grab, a bite, a handshake, etc., but must involve physical contact for at least one full combat round. This may require a successful Grapple attempt if in combat, or Agility roll if outside of combat. No roll is required for an immobile or willing target, and an attempt against an unwary target is Easy. To continue to transfer points to an unwilling target on successive rounds, the maneuver (Grapple, etc.) must be rolled successfully each combat round. Failure breaks the contact.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Once contact has been established, your character can begin to transfer points. If the target is willing or unconscious, no resistance roll is required.

A recipient can resist with a Stamina roll.</li>\n<li><strong>Power Points</strong>: If your character&rsquo;s power point total reaches 0, they fall unconscious. A recipient can resist with a Luck roll.</li>\n<li><strong>Fatigue Points</strong>: If your character&rsquo;s fatigue points reach 0, see the rules for&nbsp; Fatigue. A recipient can resist with a Stamina roll.</li>\n<li><strong>Sanity Points</strong>: Adding sanity points does not eliminate any temporary or indefinite insanity the target suffers&mdash;it merely increases the chance of success for future sanity rolls.

The barrier is usually placed to protect against attacks or attackers, though it can appear anywhere within range. Each level provides a barrier 1 meter thick, 1 meter wide, and 1 meter high. These square meters can be distributed as you wish along the dimensions of width, height, and length, or spread thinner. This barrier can be shaped in any simple form: a straight or curved wall, half-sphere, etc. Whatever its configuration, the base must rest on the ground. When creating the barrier, decide how large it will be, using height &times; thickness &times; length in meters as to determine levels and power point cost. Any extra multiples can be distributed as desired anywhere along the length of the barrier.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For example, Barrier 9 can create a barrier 1 meter thick, 3 meters high, and 3 meters long (1&times;3&times;3=9).</p>\n<p>A barrier cannot be created in the air to drop onto an opponent, though a tall thin barrier could be toppled onto a foe. If so used, it does 1D6 points of damage per 1-meter section that strikes an opponent (if they do not dodge successfully). A barrier composed of an energy type&nbsp;may have additional properties, such as a barrier of fire causing incendiary damage to those who try to bypass it.</p>\n<p>Regardless of its substance, a barrier has 30 hit points. Each additional meter of material added to its thickness adds 30 hit points to its total in that spot. Most human-sized opponents need only to destroy one or two 1-meter segments to move&nbsp; through it. If desired, more &lsquo;authentic&rsquo; hit point or armor values for the barrier&rsquo;s&nbsp; substance can be found in Armor Value of Substances rules. When the power ends, the barrier dissolves, melts, retracts, or gradually disappears in an appropriate manner, unless formed of a substance that would normally remain.</p>","gmDescription":"","powerMod":[],"category":"","cpc":3,"cpcSpent":0,"level":1,"range":"15m","duration":"15 mins","pppl":"3/lvl","specialism":false,"specName":"","mainName":"Barrier","chosen":false,"failing":[]},"effects":[],"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":"brp","systemVersion":"11.0.37","coreVersion":"11.315","createdTime":1701151793912,"modifiedTime":1702582662248,"lastModifiedBy":"NiJh555W408VQRFB"},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"NiJh555W408VQRFB":3}}

Multiple types of Energy Control must be purchased separately. An obvious concept is to purchase multiple powers relating to a single energy type, such as Absorption, Armor, Energy Projection, Resistance, and Snare Projection, all based on the same type.</p>\n<p>Each level of Energy Control is equivalent to 1 point in a resistance roll.&nbsp; For example, if trying to affect an area, the level is equal to SIZ. If trying to&nbsp; overcome the STR of an opponent, the level is equal to STR.</p>\n<p>When directed at a specific target (as opposed to an environment or area), a resistance roll using the power&rsquo;s level as the active force may be required. Whenever possible, use the resistance table if the power significantly affects something (or someone).</p>\n<p>An Agility or Grapple roll may be required to touch an unwilling target, or Projection to make a ranged attack. Generally, an unaware target is Easy to hit, and a willing target requires no roll.</p>\n<p>Once a superpower is active, it can be deactivated instantaneously, ending the major effects. Lingering effects may remain (frost, smoke, sparks, etc.), but without causing damage unless activating some aspect of the environment (sparks lighting a forest fire, etc.).</p>\n<p>Following are specific guidelines for each energy type:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cold Control</strong>: Cover an item or section of floor with ice, freeze a liquid, make an item brittle and easier to shatter, or freeze an opponent&rsquo;s limb (or entire body) as with Snare Projection. The power affects 1 SIZ point per level, where applicable. Defeat the target&rsquo;s CON vs. the superpower&rsquo;s levels in a resistance roll. Failure means that the target takes 1D6 damage per 10 levels of Cold Control (round up) from the intense cold. Any appropriate environmental effects&nbsp; may also be applied. Protection such as winterized clothing may serve as Protection 1 or more, at your gamemaster&rsquo;s discretion. Each level of Cold Control cancels the effects of one level of Heat Control.</li>\n<li><strong>Darkness Control</strong>: Each level creates a volume of darkness two meters in radius, centered around the character or at a point within range of their choosing. Within this volume, all creatures without some form of infrared vision suffer all penalties of fighting in darkness. Any normal benefits from intense darkness also apply, such as to the Hide skill. Darkness Control does not cause any damage. There is no resistance to Darkness Control, as it is not directly cast on a target. The only counter to it is a lightbased power, a non-visual sense, a super sense, or some other means of detection such as sonar. Each additional level&nbsp; adds another meter to the volume of darkness. Darkness Control cancels Light Control on a level-for-level basis.</li>\n<li><strong>Electric Control</strong>: Manipulating ambient electric current or generating fresh current. Each level provides enough electricity to affect 1 SIZ point of an electrical appliance or vehicle. Additionally, the power can cause 1D6 electrical damage per 10 levels (round up), if a resistance roll is made with the superpower&rsquo;s levels vs. the target&rsquo;s CON. Other uses may include shorting out any non-insulated&nbsp; equipment that has metallic parts and runs on a power current (use the object&rsquo;s SIZ in a resistance roll), or to transfer ambient electricity into a storage battery at the rate of 1 power point per point of stored electricity.</li>\n<li><strong>Gravity Control</strong>: Increase or decrease a target&rsquo;s SIZ by 1 point per level (similar to Density Control). The target can be a living being or an inanimate object. This may adjust hit points and the damage modifier. If used against an object, use the superpower&rsquo;s levels vs. the object&rsquo;s hit points for the resistance roll. Against another character, it is an opposed power points resistance roll. A character whose SIZ has doubled or been reduced by half (round up) involuntarily has all their combat and physical actions made Difficult, due to their unfamiliarity with the current weight. If the target is accustomed to this power&rsquo;s effects, or is voluntarily under its influence, there is no modifier. Gravity Control can be used offensively causing physical damage from intense gravity. Once a target is under its effects, on the powers phase of the next round, the gravity can be increased to do damage at the rate of 1D6 points per 10 levels (round up). When the power is deactivated, the target instantly&nbsp; regains its original weight.</li>\n<li><strong>Heat Control</strong>: Each level fills 1 SIZ of an area with flame or snuffs out that much existing flame. It can be shaped and otherwise manipulated, used to ignite an object, provide light, or warm an area. If directed against a living being, the target must be overcome by the superpower&rsquo;s levels vs. their power points in a resistance roll. Heat Control causes 1D6 damage per 10 levels (round up) to the target it is directed against. Heat Control can also be used to melt items, using the power&rsquo;s level vs. the object&rsquo;s SIZ or hit points in a resistance roll, adjusting the object&rsquo;s SIZ based on how meltable it is. Each successful resistance roll melting an object does the power&rsquo;s level in damage to the object and lowers its SIZ by the same amount. When the hit points or SIZ reach 0, the object is melted completely. Heat Control cancels the effects of Cold Control on a level-for-level basis.</li>\n<li><strong>Kinetic Control</strong>: Exert crushing force on an item or targeted opponent, affecting an area equal to 1 SIZ per level. If a target&rsquo;s CON is overcome with the superpower&rsquo;s levels on a resistance roll, they suffer 1D6 damage per 10 levels (round up) from pure kinetic force. If directed against a nonliving target, the object&rsquo;s current hit points are used for the resistance roll. It can also inhibit kinetic force in an area, creating a form of armor against physical attacks or action. This can lessen damage from a fall or duplicate the effects of Armor (Kinetic), though it must be targeted specifically and only lasts one combat round. If uncertain about what Kinetic Control can do, assume it is the equivalent of a rapid or forceful movement, not subtle or dexterous.</li>\n<li><strong>Light Control</strong>: Each level fills 1 SIZ point of an area or illuminates 1 SIZ point of an object with the brightness of a light bulb. The light can be of any color desired, and can strobe, pulse, or radiate from any source within range. Light Control can potentially blind a target if it strikes them in the eyes with a successful strike and they are overcome in a resistance roll of the superpower&rsquo;s levels vs their power points. All sight-based actions for a blinded character become Difficult for one combat round, after which the blindness wears off. Light Control does not cause damage. Additional forms of light (infrared, ultraviolet, etc.) may also be created and used by this power, with effects to be determined by you and your gamemaster, using the superpower&rsquo;s levels as a guideline. Light Control cancels the effects of Darkness Control on a level-for-level basis. For laser intensity, see Energy Projection (Light).</li>\n<li><strong>Magnetic Control</strong>: Affect, magnetize, and manipulate 1 SIZ per level of metal or metallic substances, move them using magnetism, or affix one metallic object to another magnetically. Magnetic Control does not cause damage to most living beings, though it can be used to damage any mechanical item with metallic parts (use the object&rsquo;s SIZ in a resistance roll) and disrupt electronic equipment or erase magnetically stored electronic media (memory cards, hard drives, disks, etc.). If using Magnetic Control against a countering force, use the object&rsquo;s SIZ for a resistance roll.</li>\n<li><strong>Radiation Control</strong>: Flood an area 1 SIZ per level with radiation equaling 1 potency (POT) per level or eliminate it in the same area. When used against a living being, defeat the target&rsquo;s CON in the resistance roll vs. the superpower&rsquo;s level. Radiation Control inflicts 1D6 damage per 10 levels (round up) to the target. To cause radiation poisoning, overcome the target&rsquo;s CON+POW vs. the power&rsquo;s level in a resistance roll. The nature of this radiation must be approved by your gamemaster.</li>\n<li><strong>Sound Control</strong>: Affect 1 SIZ per level of an object or the sound in an area, silencing it, increasing its volume, etc. This power can also duplicate sonic or ultrasonic forms of sound. In combat, create a cacophony or loud blast of painful sound, using the superpower&rsquo;s level vs. the target&rsquo;s CON in a resistance roll. Success means that the target is stunned for 1D3 rounds. Additionally, for the duration of the stunned state, the target&rsquo;s Listen skill rolls are Impossible and mental skill rolls are Difficult. For less offensive uses, create phantom noises, mimic sounds, transfer sound from one place to another (within range), and even duplicate any sound previously heard (use an Idea roll to determine how correctly the sound is remembered). Sound Control can also destroy inanimate objects, doing 1D6 points of damage per 10 levels (round up) to an object whose hit points or CON is overcome in a resistance roll. Sound Control can oppose itself as well as other sound-based attacks such as Sound Projection.</li>\n<li><strong>Wind Control</strong>: Control the wind, stirring air currents to incredible force, whether in a straight line or whirlwind. Though Wind Control does not cause direct damage, it can oppose foes&rsquo; movement, hold a target in place in a vortex of wind, blow something onto a target, hinder missile weapons used in range, create a tornado, fill a sail with wind, fan a fire into an inferno, or blow a fire out. Use the rules for knockback (page 149), using the power&rsquo;s level, where applicable. Wind Control is not subtle, and its effects are often difficult to control. When appropriate, use the power&rsquo;s levels vs. the target&rsquo;s SIZ or STR in a resistance roll. Weather Conditions includes other effects that might be simulated using Wind Control.</li>\n<li><strong>Other Energy Control</strong>: This category covers any undefined or new sort of Energy Control you and your gamemaster may devise. The guidelines for the other types of Energy Control can be used to determine the parameters for new types of energy, with the following guidelines: 1 level equals 1 SIZ point of energy to be manipulated or generated; if appropriate, the power will do 1D6 points of damage per 10 levels of the power (round up); base range is 15 meters. When in doubt, determine a means by which the superpower can be used in a resistance roll.</li>\n<li><strong>Combined Energy Control</strong>: Your character can combine these superpowers if they pay the full amount for each Energy Control type. Each aspect of the power will have full effectiveness, though damage is rolled separately for each type, as the target may have different types of Absorption, Armor, Protection, or Resistance. Levels of combined Energy Control types do not have to be equivalent. All special effects for each Energy Control type are added onto this attack. For combined attacks, each use costs the full amount of power points required for the power.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You and your gamemaster should discuss further potential uses for each energy type, though whenever the use of the superpower seems to duplicate another power, that superpower should be purchased instead. This superpower does not grant immunity to the energy type being used&mdash;instead, the character<br>is immune to the initial release of the energy but is susceptible to it later. Purchase levels in Absorption, Armor, Protection, or Resistance, if desired. Many of these energy types can be used to duplicate or mimic environmental effects.</p>","gmDescription":"","powerMod":[],"category":"","cpc":3,"cpcSpent":0,"level":1,"range":"15m or touch","duration":"1 CR","pppl":"1/lvl per CR","specialism":true,"specName":"specify","mainName":"Energy Control","chosen":false,"failing":[]},"effects":[],"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":"brp","systemVersion":"11.0.37","coreVersion":"11.315","createdTime":1701237563006,"modifiedTime":1702582662248,"lastModifiedBy":"NiJh555W408VQRFB"},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"NiJh555W408VQRFB":3}}

Each type must be purchased separately, but there are no levels&mdash;the movement simply works if the power points are spent. Carrying capacity is based on normal STR, and heavy weights are handled with a resistance roll. Following are some common Super Movement types. You and your gamemaster may devise others using these as examples.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Air Walking</strong>: Walking upon the air itself, as on invisible walkways and staircases, immaterial to anyone else. Your character can carry others, as if on normal ground.</li>\n<li><strong>Irresistible</strong>: Moving through water or any environmental condition as if without resistance. Hazards that would normally slow movement (water, mud, etc.) are no hindrance, allowing the full movement rate. This also applies to movement speed outside of combat, ignoring weather or terrain effects, but it does not apply to resistance from unnatural conditions, such as Snare Projection or a physical barrier.</li>\n<li><strong>Lightfoot</strong>: Lightfoot allows a normal movement rate while in the air, leaping from surface to surface, gliding, skipping, or making slight motions upon solid surfaces to maintain movement. Lightfoot lets your character stand on surfaces that would not normally support their weight, such as a bamboo reed, a slender tree branch, a sword point, or even a house of cards. moving as if gravity has no effect. Your character can run lightly up rough walls or trees, or even skip across water or the surface of snow. They cannot remain in the air indefinitely, and to change direction (right, left, or even up or down) requires a successful Agility roll as well as additional power points spent.</li>\n<li><strong>Trackless</strong>: Moving across the ground or the surface of snow and leaving absolutely no track unless desired. Only special successes on Track rolls can find a Trackless trail, and the result will only be a standard success. Your character can stand still or even cartwheel across a surface and will not leave tracks. This power is intrinsic and cannot be shared. Carrying any more than a normal burden negates it entirely.</li>\n<li><strong>Wall Walking</strong>: Walking on walls and ceilings, whether on all fours or standing upright. Your character can stand still on vertical or upside-down surfaces as if on the ground, and jumping keeps them on the same plane.&nbsp; Carrying additional weight must be handled through a normal STR resistance roll.</li>\n<li><strong>Water Walking</strong>: Walking or running across water as if it were solid ground, meeting no resistance from waves and not sinking. Unlike Lightfoot, your character can stand still on the water&rsquo;s surface, though turbulent water will cause them to sway with the motions of the waves. Your character can also surf along rapid-moving water, riding the current and being swept along as if on a surfboard or conveyor belt. Your gamemaster should&nbsp; determine how rapid the water is and may require Agility or Jump rolls to overcome obstacles such as outcropping stones in river rapids.</li>\n<li><strong>Zero-gravity</strong>: Your character can ignore the effects of zero gravity, orienting their body in relation to whatever object or plane in threedimensional space they inhabit. Your character can move easily through zero-g environments, incurring no penalties to actions, and even when in deep space will always be able to find a comfortable orientation. They can use Super Movement (Zero-gravity) to orient other characters in zero-g through touch.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When using Super Movement, if a conscious character falls, they can attempt an Idea roll to remain on the surface they are on (air, water, ceiling, wall, etc.) rather than sink or fall to earth. If your character is knocked unconscious or runs out of power points while using Super Movement, they fall to the ground, sink beneath the water, etc. as appropriate. If your character is using normal movement and is presented with an opportunity, they can make a Difficult Agility roll to switch to Super Movement, such as being hurled through the air towards a wall and using Lightfoot or Wall Walking to land on the wall, in control and unharmed.</p>","gmDescription":"","powerMod":[],"category":"","cpc":"10 per type","cpcSpent":0,"level":1,"range":"Self","duration":"Varies","pppl":"1/CR","specialism":false,"specName":"","mainName":"Super Movement","chosen":false,"failing":[]},"effects":[],"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":"brp","systemVersion":"11.0.37","coreVersion":"11.315","createdTime":1701325351468,"modifiedTime":1702582662248,"lastModifiedBy":"NiJh555W408VQRFB"},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"NiJh555W408VQRFB":3}}

It works similarly to Drain, though in the opposite direction. The rate of this transfer is 1 point per level per combat round, with additional levels increasing the points transferrable (level 2 transfers 2 points, etc.). The means can be a grab, a bite, a handshake, etc., but must involve physical contact for at least one full combat round. This may require a successful Grapple attempt if in combat, or Agility roll if outside of combat. No roll is required for an immobile or willing target, and an attempt against an unwary target is Easy. To continue to transfer points to an unwilling target on successive rounds, the maneuver (Grapple, etc.) must be rolled successfully each combat round. Failure breaks the contact.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Once contact has been established, your character can begin to transfer points. If the target is willing or unconscious, no resistance roll is required. An unwilling target can resist using a particular characteristic roll, described below. If they succeed in resisting, the transfer has no effect, and the intended recipient can attempt to break free.

A recipient can resist with a Stamina roll.</li>\n<li><strong>Power Points</strong>: If your character&rsquo;s power point total reaches 0, they fall unconscious. A recipient can resist with a Luck roll.</li>\n<li><strong>Fatigue Points</strong>: If your character&rsquo;s fatigue points reach 0, see the rules for&nbsp; Fatigue. A recipient can resist with a Stamina roll.</li>\n<li><strong>Sanity Points</strong>: Adding sanity points does not eliminate any temporary or indefinite insanity the target suffers&mdash;it merely increases the chance of success for future sanity rolls.

Additionally, it can scramble any electric or electronic equipment it hits, using its power level against the item&rsquo;s hit points in a resistance roll.</li>\n<li><strong>Gravity Projection</strong>: A pure wave of gravitic energy, causing everything it hits to either become incredibly heavy or light, as desired, doing 1D6 damage per level. In addition to damage, it can sweep items aside or cause them to plummet to the ground, taking damage as appropriate.</li>\n<li><strong>Heat Projection</strong>: A line of flame or intense heat, doing 1D6 damage per level, with a POW&times;level chance of setting a flammable object on fire in addition to any damage it causes.</li>\n<li><strong>Kinetic Projection</strong>: A beam of concussive force doing 1D6 damage per level, that on a special success also inflicts the effects of a crushing special success or knockback (player choice).</li>\n<li><strong>Light Projection</strong>: A laser-like ray of light, doing 1D6 damage per level. It can temporarily blind an opponent for 1D3 combat rounds if it strikes them in the eyes and the power brightly illuminates the area when it is used. If directed against an inanimate object (such as a wall or safe) for multiple rounds, it can cut through them, doing its normal damage.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Magnetic Projection</strong>: This wave of magnetic force does 1D6 damage per level to electronic circuitry or machinery made of ferrous materials. Use the power&rsquo;s level as the active force against the object&rsquo;s hit point total in a resistance roll. If used against metallic objects, it can knock them back into other targets, doing damage as appropriate to SIZ.</li>\n<li><strong>Radiation Projection</strong>: This beam of radioactive energy does 1D6 damage per level and can irradiate anything it hits, causing potential radiological reactions (exposing film, etc.) or even radiation sickness, using the damage dealt as its potency (POT).</li>\n<li><strong>Sound Projection</strong>: A shock wave radiating along a path towards the target, doing 1D6 damage per level. If targeted against the head or ears of a target, it can temporarily deafen them for 1D3 combat rounds if the power level overcomes their CON in a&nbsp; resistance roll.&nbsp; All hearing-based actions for a deafened character become Difficult<br>until the deafness wears off.</li>\n<li><strong>Wind Projection</strong>: An intense blast of wind doing 1D6 damage per level and a knockback special success if the dice&nbsp;roll indicates so.

The guidelines for the other types of Energy Projection can be used to determine the parameters for new types of energy, with the following guidelines: 1 level equals 1 SIZ point of energy to be manipulated or generated; if appropriate, the power will do 1D6 points of damage per 10 levels of the power (round up); base range is 15 meters. When in doubt, determine a means by which the superpower can be used in a resistance roll.</li>\n<li><strong>Combined Energy Projection</strong>: These attacks can be combined if each Energy Projection type is purchased separately. Levels do not have to be equivalent. A single successful Projection roll means that all Energy Projection types hit the target. Each Energy&nbsp; Projection type has its normal effectiveness, though resistance rolls and side effects must be determined separately. Damage is rolled separately for each type, as the target may have different types of Absorption, Armor, Protection, or Resistance. For combined Energy Projection attacks, each attack costs the full amount of power points for all levels and all types of energy used.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Many of these have variable effectiveness against certain types of defenses, such as a Fire Projection being weak against cold-based defenses, or a Magnetic Projection being especially powerful against metallic defenses.

If the Sidekick is a natural animal, determine its&nbsp; characteristics and skills normally, adjusting as desired, and then pay for them, using the above powers. The Sidekick can have powers and equipment, but these must also be paid for out of your character&rsquo;s point budget.</p>\n<p>Generally, a Sidekick has powers and skills like its &lsquo;owner&rsquo;, though this is not necessary. A Sidekick usually has the following attributes:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is loyal to the owner, though it may disagree and occasionally rebel.</li>\n<li>It often idolizes its owner and fashions its appearance after them.</li>\n<li>It depends on its owner for living arrangements and necessities.</li>\n<li>It often gets into trouble, and sometimes must be rescued.
