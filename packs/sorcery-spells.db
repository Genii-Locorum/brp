Usually, demons have both a general name and a true name. The demon is summoned under the former; the latter is closely guarded, as it gives power over the demon. The spell is relatively short but relaying the requirements of the demon to be summoned, and the negotiation with that entity takes 1D8 hours to do correctly. Summoning a demon costs 9 power points (in total), paid when the demon appears.</p>\n<p>Alternately, at the end of the 1D8 hours of specifying the demon, the sorcerer may attempt to bind it into their service. Binding a demon costs the summoner 1 point of permanent POW, or 3 points of permanent POW to permanently bind the demon into an object.</p>\n<p>To attempt to bind a demon, roll the summoner&rsquo;s POW (before the permanent POW is spent) vs. the demon&rsquo;s POW in a resistance roll. If successful, the sorcerer now&nbsp; owns the demon.</p>\n<p>When a demon is bound, a sorcerer can control its actions. If the roll fails, the demon escapes and will never again deal with that sorcerer. Typically, a sorcerer is&nbsp; limited to their INT in D8s of demon POW, counting against the sorcery spell limit.</p>\n<p>For example, a POW 3D8 demon counts as 3 levels of INT that a sorcerer cannot fill with sorcery spells.</p>\n<p>Several types of bindings exist. A demon can be bound into the flesh, appearing as it does in its home plane; or it can be bound into an object or place. An ordinary&nbsp; binding lasts as long as a sorcerer lives or until they dismiss the demon. Permanently binding a demon creates a unique item or place with demonic powers and qualities that last long after a sorcerer dies, or until the object or place is destroyed. A bound demon responds only to its binder. If the demon is bound in an&nbsp; object, that object appears and functions as ordinary to anyone except the binder.&nbsp; If the binding object is broken, the demon dies.</p>\n<p>Following are some general rules regarding demons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A bound demon counts against a sorcerer&rsquo;s INT limit of memory,<br>even if the demon is sent to another universe.</li>\n<li>A demon might be bound within an amulet, a ring, a wall of stone, a sword, etc. It retains only its abilities, its INT and POW, and other characteristics necessary to its abilities or skills. In all other aspects, the demon and the&nbsp; object into which it is bound are equivalent. The demon cannot move from the object until it is dismissed.</li>\n<li>Once bound, a demon surrenders its true name to its summoner.</li>\n<li>If the demon&rsquo;s true name is known to the sorcerer, they can dismiss it, and then summon that same demon again to bind it once more. The demon is now a&nbsp; known quantity and its dice of POW do not count against the memory INT limit.</li>\n<li>A sorcerer that knows a demon&rsquo;s true name can keep it bound, send it to its home plane, then call it back. This takes one combat round. In this way, a demon that is already bound and on another plane can reappear in a matter of&nbsp; seconds. Holding a demon in this way counts against the INT limit to memory.&nbsp; The demon appears through some focusing object touched by a sorcerer&nbsp; (summoner&rsquo;s choice as to what the item is) and seems to emerge from it. The&nbsp; focusing object must be visibly marked with some sigil or item to specify its nature.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The sorcerer that binds a demon can dismiss it at any time. This eliminates the binding, takes 1D6 minutes, and costs no power points. The demon slowly&nbsp; evaporates in steam, smoke, and flame, and disappears. The binder retains&nbsp; knowledge of the demon&rsquo;s true name, but the demon is removed from the INT limit to memory. A dismissed bound demon departs the object in which it has been&nbsp; bound. If it is later summoned again, it appears in its natural form and is not bound into the object. However, it can be bound again into the same object, place, or shape.</p>\n<p>There are four ways to break an ordinary binding:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The summoner can dismiss the demon.</li>\n<li>Killing the demon frees it.</li>\n<li>Killing the sorcerer who bound the demon.</li>\n<li>Learning the demon&rsquo;s true name and successfully rebinding it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A permanent binding cannot be destroyed except by destroying the object the demon is bound into. A bound demon that has been mistreated or whose needs have been neglected may be persuaded to reveal its true name to a second person.&nbsp; It will seek to be dismissed by that second person in exchange for some negotiated&nbsp; task. Since it may be immortal, a demon can afford patience. It will not casually&nbsp; give its true name to someone if it does not suspect that it will achieve its freedom.</p>","gmDescription":"","mem":false,"range":"Sight","pppl":9,"powCost":"1 or 3","maxLvl":1,"currLvl":1,"memLvl":1,"var":false},"effects":[],"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":"brp","systemVersion":"11.0.37","coreVersion":"11.315","createdTime":1700401556261,"modifiedTime":1702582649775,"lastModifiedBy":"NiJh555W408VQRFB"},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"NiJh555W408VQRFB":3}}

Brazier of Power is incompatible with Chain of Being, and if one is cast on a target, the other will have no effect. Traditionally, the focus for the reservoir is a large brazier, but it could be any sturdy, solid place or thing. If the focus is moved or destroyed, the attunement is lost, and a new focus must be established from scratch.</p>\n<p>The first time Brazier of Power is cast, the sorcerer must sacrifice 4 power points and 1 permanent point of POW to attune the focus. Once successful, the sorcerer can store any remaining power points in the focus.&nbsp;The focus accepts new power points at any time up to the maximum of a sorcerer&rsquo;s POW when the focus was created (after the sacrifice).</p>\n<p>The sorcerer must be in physical contact with the brazier to draw power points from it. Only its creator can use the power points directly. However, if they have another means of transferring power points to another character, power points must first be drawn from the sorcerer, then from the brazier. To make a focus of greater capacity, a sorcerer must cast the spell again upon the same item, sacrificing another point of POW and the necessary power points. In this fashion, a Brazier of&nbsp;Power can become an immense reservoir of power points. Many serious sorcerers use Braziers of Power in their lairs or sanctuaries .</p>","gmDescription":"","mem":false,"range":"Touch","pppl":1,"powCost":"1","maxLvl":4,"currLvl":4,"memLvl":4,"var":false},"effects":[],"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":"brp","systemVersion":"11.0.37","coreVersion":"11.315","createdTime":1700383445629,"modifiedTime":1702582649775,"lastModifiedBy":"NiJh555W408VQRFB"},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"NiJh555W408VQRFB":3}}
